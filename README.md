# object-detection-model-to-detect-a-smaller-object
Development of object detection model to detect a smaller object/s in a given image.

Introduction 

Keras implementation of RetinaNet object detection as described in Focal Loss for Dense Object Detection by Tsung-Yi Lin, Priya Goyal, Ross Girshick, Kaiming He and Piotr Doll√°r.

This code is borrowed from Keras Implementation of this model at https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet and updated to run on Stanford Drone Data Set
